# Accelerating DNA Sequence Alignment Using Optimized AI Techniques

## Overview

This repository presents a machine learning-based framework to accelerate DNA sequence alignment by replacing computationally expensive traditional algorithms with optimized artificial intelligence techniques. The project implements and compares the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks (Bi-LSTM), and Random Forest (RF) classifiers for high-accuracy and low-latency sequence alignment.

## Key Features

- Implements CNN, Bi-LSTM, and Random Forest models for classification of DNA sequence alignments
- Achieves up to **99.97% accuracy** using CNN with reduced training time
- Provides a balanced trade-off between accuracy, speed, and hardware requirements
- Suitable for large-scale genomic applications like disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and evolutionary analysis

## Problem Statement

Traditional sequence alignment algorithms such as Needleman-Wunsch (NW) are mathematically optimal but computationally expensive, especially for long sequences or large datasets. They exhibit a time complexity of \(O(MN)\), where \(M\) and \(N\) are the lengths of the sequences to be aligned. This project explores how machine learning models can overcome these limitations by learning alignment patterns in advance, thereby reducing computational time and making the process scalable for real-time applications.
